# Chapter 5 What's next?

If you liked some of the topics in this course, may be wondering
what's next.

## Real Analysis
	
From where you are, it's easy to define the notion of continuity formally and starting to prove theorems about continuous functions, and limits of functions in general. Then you will see how to formally define the derivative and start proving things about it. You're probably not scared of differentiation, but you perhaps *should* be cautious of differentiating functions of several variables. Integration is a bit more technical, and will require more work.

The above are the themes that you will encounter in the Analysis Part of the Year 2 course "Further Pure Mathematics".
	
Sooner or later, you can try using the same techniques in more exotic surroundings: the concepts of approximation we started talking about in this course give us a way in to studying abstract concepts of space. The first steps of this theory are covered in the Year 3 courses "MAS331 Metric Spaces". Roughly speaking, one endows a given set with a notion of distance (the role of which in $\mathbb{R}$ was played by $d(x,y)=|x-y|$). With this notion one can start talking about distances, limits, approximations, closed and open sets, completeness, compactness etc. A very useful part of the theory revolves around Functional Spaces (further developed in the Year 4 course "Functional Analysis") where one considers spaces whose "points"/elements are functions! One can then try to define notions of distance between functions, and even talk about limits of sequences of functions! A lot of unexpected phenomena take place in these spaces, giving rise to a beautiful and exciting theory. Just to whet your appetite: it is possible to define different notions of convergence (on the same space), so that the same sequence may or may not have a limit depending on which notion is used. Luckily, you don't have to wait too long: already in the Year 2 course you will see examples of that in the space of continuous functions, i.e., the space where every point is a continuous function.
